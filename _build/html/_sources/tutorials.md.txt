# Tutorials
We are providing series of tutorials in order to help genGEO's user a first in-hand experience.
We are providing interactive code cells in order enable genGEO users to get their first and quick estimation for many geothermal power system. This option was made available with a kernel provided by [Binder](https://mybinder.org).

For example, by clicking the button below, you will notice that the code block beneath becomes editable and runnable!

```{thebe-button} Launch thebe
```

```{code-block} python
:class: thebe

print("hi")
```

## Example CPG system

An example file is provided with ```exampleCPGSystemStudy.py```. This example implements a CPG system and solves for a number of reservoir depths and permeabilities. It contains a large number of scenarios and therefore runs for a long time. Hence, it should only be used as an example to derive other studies from.
