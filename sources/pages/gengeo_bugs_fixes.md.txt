# known genGEO's Bugs

This page contains a living list of known bugs. Certain bugs may be ignored, as they only affect (often rarely used) program options or combination of features; others may be fixed with only a few code changes; yet others may require more subtantial recoding. Please consult the [developers](https://geg.ethz.ch/people/).
