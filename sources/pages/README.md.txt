# **genGEO**: **gen**eralizable **GEO**thermal techno-economic simulator


![genGEO logo](../media/full_logo.png)


**genGEO**, an open-source and object-oriented python library, is a generalizable geothermal simulator, which is used as a techno-economic tool for determining the electric power and cost of a wide range of geothermal systems (i.e., CO2-based Geothermal system, Advanced Geothermal System, ...).

genGEO is an integrated reservoir-electricity-cost geothermal simulator, composed of a reservoir model which simulates the working fluid's energy and pressure change in the porous reservoir, a well model which simulates the working fluid's energy and pressure change in the wellbores, a thermodynamic power cycle model which simulates electric power generation, and a cost model which evaluates the capital costs.
