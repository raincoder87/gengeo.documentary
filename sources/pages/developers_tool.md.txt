## genGEO Bugs
The genGEO codes are continually updated in response to new scientific challenges and user needs. While the genGEO codes are thoroughly tested before release, exhaustive testing is not possible. Consequently, developers and users occasionally detect programming bugs in a released code version. These bugs are fixed as they become known.

Please provide a *minimum reproducible example* to be more efficient in identifying the bug and fixing it for you. Have you heard about [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)? Please use Markdown syntax when writing your issues.
