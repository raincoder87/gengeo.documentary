# Jupyter Notebooks

This page was written for [MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/).
It demonstrates `sphinx-thebe`'s usage with Jupyter Notebooks.

Activate Thebe by clicking the launch button below.
You should then be able to run and edit the code cell in the notebook.

```{thebe-button} Launch thebe
```

```{code-block} python
:class: thebe

print("hi")
```
